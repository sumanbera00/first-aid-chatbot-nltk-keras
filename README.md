Repository Description:

Welcome to the "First Aid Chatbot using NLTK and Keras" repository! This project implements a chatbot system designed to provide first aid assistance using natural language processing (NLP) techniques with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and deep learning models built with Keras.

The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive platform where users can seek guidance and information on first aid procedures, symptoms, and general medical inquiries. Leveraging NLTK's powerful text processing capabilities, the chatbot intelligently interprets user queries and generates relevant responses in real-time.

In addition to its chatbot functionality, the repository also includes a hospital lookup feature, allowing users to easily find nearby medical facilities by providing their location's pincode. This feature enhances the usability of the application by offering users quick access to essential medical resources when needed.

Key features of the repository include:

A first aid chatbot powered by NLTK and Keras, capable of understanding and responding to user queries.
Integration of a hospital lookup feature, enabling users to locate nearby medical facilities based on pincode information.
An intuitive user interface designed for ease of interaction, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical proficiency.
Built with Python and Flask framework for web application development, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Using the repository is straightforward:

Clone the repository to your local machine and follow the provided installation instructions to set up the chatbot system.
Interact with the chatbot by entering your queries into the input box provided on the user interface.
Explore the hospital lookup feature by entering pincode information and accessing nearby medical facilities.
Provide feedback or contribute to the project to help improve its functionality and usability for all users.
Whether you're seeking quick first aid guidance or looking to contribute to the advancement of NLP-driven chatbot technology, this repository offers a valuable platform for both users and developers alike. Join us in our mission to make first aid information accessible and readily available to everyone!
